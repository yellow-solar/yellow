A file ending in .sh is a shell script and can be executed in the terminal with:

source <script.sh>

It will executre each line in the file as if it was you typing into the terminal.


Powerful mix: shell script + cron


If you have multiple jobs to run on the same schedule, rather put them into a single shell script
Then you can easily add/remove.
